## Project Overview

Join offers small teams and individuals a clear and efficient way to organize projects, tasks, and team members. The tool is based on the Kanban method: tasks are managed as cards and move through status columns – "To Do", "In Progress", "Await Feedback", and "Done". Each task can be enriched with further details such as priority, due date, and subtasks.
